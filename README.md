# Finance Use Case - Agentic Workflow

This is the source code of the IBM Developer article published here []

 Note that this is PoC quality code not meant to be deployed as-is in a production environment. The source code has not been containerized. The code has been tested in a MacBook Pro laptop with macOS Sequoia 15.14 but it could be adapted to other platforms.

There is a separate folder for the back-end, front-end and agentic workflow. Each folder has a README.md file that describes in detail how to stand up the layer. Make sure you carefully follow the instructions in each README.md file.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/IBM/i-oic-better-together-data-ai-assistants-finance.git
    ```
2. Stand up the back-end layer including deploying the MongoDB container, the back-end APIs and loading the sample bank customer data.

3. Stand up the agentic workflow API.

4. Stand up the front-end web application.
