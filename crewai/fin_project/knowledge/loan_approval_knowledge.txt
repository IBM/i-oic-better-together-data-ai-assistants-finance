*** Bank Loan Approval Rules ***

In order to minimize the likelihood of loan default, the bank will not approve 
any loan with a risk level value of "high", regardless of the credit score.

The bank will approve loans with risk level value of "medium" only when 
the credit score is above 700. Do not use additional conditions to approve the loan.

The bank will approve loans with risk level value of "low" only when 
the credit score is above 600. Do not use additional conditions to approve the loan.
